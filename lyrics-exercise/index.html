        <h1>Spider Web</h1>
        <h2>Melanie Martinez</h2>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>I move like a moth or a butterfly</p>
            <p>Craving a change in the wind</p>
            <p>I swirl by all the insects and all the flies</p>
            <p>Watching the cycle they're in</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Better off dead than wasting my hours</p>
            <p>Flying where I shouldn't be</p>
            <p>Flexing like pricks with their stolen power</p>
            <p>They're just who the spider will eat</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Spinning all your silk and moving all of your eight legs</p>
            <p>To build a web that'll spread through the world</p>
            <p>Feeding off our highs and lows</p>
            <p>And curious to see us struggle</p>
            <p>No one can leave once they merge</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Oh, no one can leave once they merge</p>
            <p>Oh, no one can leave once they merge</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>I'm hiding myself from the enemy</p>
            <p>I wish to not be perceived</p>
            <p>Didn't ask for this dangerous visibility</p>
            <p>I'm feeling too scared to sleep</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Better off dead than stuck in a maze</p>
            <p>The center may seem like a gift</p>
            <p>Once you arrive, it'll strip you of your life</p>
            <p>And you'll wish that you never did</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Spinning all your silk and moving all of your eight legs</p>
            <p>To build a web that'll spread through the world</p>
            <p>Feeding off our highs and lows</p>
            <p>And curious to see us struggle</p>
            <p>No one can leave once they merge</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Oh, no one can leave once they merge</p>
            <p>Oh, no one can leave once they merge</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Big bite, they liquify the insides first</p>
            <p>Then wrap them tight, securing their spot in the spider web</p>
            <p>Up all night, bound to their addiction to it</p>
            <p>Lifeless eyes, they die in the pit of the spider web</p>
        </div>
