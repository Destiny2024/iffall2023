        <h1>When Steak Met Potatoes</h1>
        <h2>and Creamed Kale with Peppercorn Sauce</h2>
            
        <section>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                When cooking a date-night dinner for a loved one (or indulging in some personal TLC), 
                it's best to keep it simple, cupid. You're more likely to impress by showing off your mastery of the classics than by breaking out the brulee blowtorch and nearly setting something on fire. 
                So say “I love you” with a meal that never fails to please: steak and potatoes with creamed veggies and a peppercorn sauce. 
                Call it steak au poivre if you wanna get fancy.
            </p>

            <h3>Recipe Websites</h3>
            <a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43166134/pancake-recipe/">Delish</a>
            <p>I  think it's nice that the website prioritizes both the recipe name and the author's information for crediting. 
                Having the star rating listed at the top is a good idea. The recipe description section is a bit long, but a button for “jumping to recipe” fixes the possible inconvenience.
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-potato-pancakes-233361">Epicurious</a>
            <p>Similar to Delish, recipe name, author name, and rating are listed at the top. The total time it takes it also displayed, which is convenient to know before starting the recipe steps.
                The introduction is a little longer, which I don't expect when finding a recipe.
                The ingredient heading also includes how many the recipe serves, which would be good to include.</p>
            <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/fluffy-japanese-pancakes#tips">Tasty</a>
            <p>I love that there is a “tips” section for anyone that has attempted to make the recipe, and the percentage recommend feature is a good alternative to the star rating system. 
                The recipe image takes up a lot of space at the top, which entices the reader to create the end product.</p>
            <a href="https://weegallery.com/">WeeGallery</a>
            <p>The pictures are presented in a gallery format that can help influence the image layout in my recipe.</p>
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a>
            <p>As a popular social media app, I think this has a good use of icons for social use that can inform my own design.</p>
            <a href="yelp.com">Yelp</a>
            <p>This is a website that primarily deals with sharing user reviews, so I think I can use the layout to inform my decisions about possibly having a rating/review portion of the recipe website.</p>
