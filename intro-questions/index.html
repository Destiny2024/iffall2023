            </li>
            <li>
                Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.
                <p>My hometown is Memphis, Tennessee. I'm taking this class becauase I enjoy both computers and design.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.
                <p>I've taken CSE 204 and have experience tutoring high school students learning HTML/CSS/JS,
                    so I have a foundational understanding, but I would like to explore more concepts within CSS.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.
                <p>I hope to learn how to vissually appealing web pages for coding projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
                <p>I would expect a learning curve in applying design concepts to screen, since there is always the possibility of errors.
                    More things would need to be taken into consideration like typical screen sizes (phone, tablet vs laptop, desktop).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.
                <p> <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a> </p>
                <p>Amazon's website exemplifies effective design because their UI offers a comprehensive view of
                    the services offered, whether in mobile or desktop view.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.
                <p> <a href="https://netflix.com">Netflix</a> </p>
                <p>I think Netflix's website exemplifies effective communication. Despite the amount of graphics on the home page,
                    the menu bar at the top includes all the functionality to navigate the website.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.
                <p> <a href="https://instagram.com">Instagram</a> </p>
                <p>Instagram works well as a social media website. Posts from other users are centered on the screen, and
                    information of interest to the user is highlighted (i.e. like counts, tags, comments). It uses well-known icons
                    to identify website functionality, like direct messaging or posting.
